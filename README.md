# GEMS
Generalizable empirical model of snow accumulation and melt
R script and corresponding files for running the Generalizable empirical model of snow accumulation and melt (GEMS). The model leverages the capabilities of machine learning methods and incorporates empirical relationships between daily changes in snow water equivalent (SWE) and precipitation, temperature, and topographic factors to produce accurate estimates of SWE.
The corresponding files include three variations of the pretrained Support Vector Regression, based on a number of the required inputs. The accompanying two datasets include observations from independent Snowpack Telemetry Network (SNOTEL) and the Snow Model Intercomparing Project (SnowMIP) stations, which were used to evaluate GEMS performance.
